# Overview  

As a software engineer aiming to enhance my learning, this project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on retail transaction data. 

The dataset sourced from kaggle contains information such as invoice details, customer demographics, shopping mall locations, and product categories.

The purpose of this analysis is to uncover insights regarding payment methods, product category preferences, customer behavior, and seasonal trends. These insights can guide decision-making processes for retail businesses.

# Data Analysis Results  

### Analysis Objectives  
1. **Payment Methods and Sales Distribution**  
   - How do different shopping malls utilize payment methods, and how does this affect their overall sales?  
   - Do malls with diverse payment options generate higher sales than others?  

2. **Product Categories and Customer Demographics**  
   - Which product categories are driving sales in the top-performing malls?  

3. **Quantity, Pricing Correlation, Customer Demographics, Behavior, and Trends**  
   - Is there a significant relationship between product categories and customer demographics, such as gender and age?  
   - Is there a correlation between product quantity sold and pricing across all malls?  
   - What trends can be observed in customer purchasing behavior based on gender, age, and payment methods?  
   - Do top-performing malls attract specific customer demographics more than others?  

### Insights  
- Malls offering multiple payment methods attract more customers, with higher sales at locations such as Kanyon and Mall of Instabul. The quantity of items available at these shopping centers makes it a preferred choice for customers as they can probably choose from a variety of items available at the store. 
- Clothing, shoes and Technology categories dominate, with younger demographics.  
- A weak positive correlation (0.34) exists between price and quantity, showing a slight trend of higher prices leading to larger quantities sold.  
- Seasonal trends reveal that sales peak in January, decline until April, rise mid-year in July, and steadily grow from October.
